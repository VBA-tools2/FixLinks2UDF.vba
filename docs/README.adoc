Excel AddIn for Fixing Links To UDFs In AddIns.

This is essentially a republish of Jan Karel Pieterse's article {uri-JKP-FixLinks2UDF}.
So all credits go to him!

The main reason for this repository is to bundle all improvements at one point.
Otherwise one has at least to dig through all the comments below the article to find them.
And in the meantime a lot of additional features/functionality has been added.

== Features

* Fix links in Workbooks to UDFs in AddIns which paths have changed
  (this is the main/original feature)
* allow fixing links also when the extension of the AddIns have changed
* allow fixing links also on (passwordless) protected Worksheets
* allow to have a "`wrapper`" AddIn (named `+FixLinks2UDF.xlam+`)

== Prerequisites / Dependencies

Since this is an Excel AddIn you obviously need Microsoft Excel.

[#how-to-install]
== How to install / Getting started

[NOTE]
====
If you want to to build the AddIn from source, please have a look at link:{doc-addin-create}[How to create the AddIn from source].
====

=== Use distributed `+FixLinks2UDF+` AddIn

The simplest way to get started is to

. download the `+FixLinks2UDF.xlam+` file (from the root folder) and save it to a place of your choice.
  (The default path for Office AddIns (on Windows) is
+
 C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns
+
which can safely be used.)
. Start Excel
. Activate the AddIn
.. by opening the menu:Add-Ins[] window (e.g. menu:Developer[Add-ins > Excel Add-ins]), and
.. adding a checkmark at the `+FixLinks2UDF+` entry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are several options/functionalities to choose from.
To check them out please have a look at link:{doc-addin-options}[AddIn options].
====

=== Modify AddIns whose UDF links should be fixed

Now the `+FixLinks2UDF+` AddIn is "`listening`" and you need to "`register`" the AddIns, whose UDF links should be fixed.
That is done by

. opening the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) (kbd:[Alt+F11]),
. adding the module link:{sourcedir}/Client/FixLinks2UDF_Client.bas[`+FixLinks2UDF_Client.bas+`] to the AddIn of your choice,
** With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
.. Right-click on the project to which you want to add the module in the "`Code Explorer`" (to show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R]) and click on menu:Sync Project[Update Components from Files...].
.. Select the corresponding file in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder and click on btn:[Open].
** Without Rubberduck:
.. Select the corresponding file(s) in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder (e.g. in the Windows Explorer).
.. Drag-and-drop them to the corresponding project in VBE's "`Project Explorer`". +
   (To show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R].
   Hit it twice if the Code Explorer shows up first.)
. adding the line,
// NOTE: Unfortunately `include::` currently is not supported by GitHub, see <https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1095>
// include::{sourcedir}/Client/ThisWorkbook.doccls[lines=5]
+
[source,vba]
----
    FixLinks2UDF_Client.RegisterAddInToFixLinks2UDF
----
+
to the `+Workbook_Open()+` event (in the `+ThisWorkbook+` class module (which can be found in the "`Microsoft Excel Objects`")), and
// BUG: "project name" can't be put in normal angle brackets, because the closing bracket would be interpreted as menu delimiter. I couldn't find a way how to "escape" that (i.e. a backslash didn't work). Thus, single guillemets are used.
. checking, if there are obvious errors by compiling the project (menu:Debug[Compile â€¹project nameâ€º]), and
. saving the AddIn.
.. Be sure that the AddIn/project you want to save is "`active`" in the VBE by checking, if its name is shown in the VBE's title bar. If it's not, open a (class) module of the corresponding AddIn (and close it again).
.. Press the "`Save`" button (the disc symbol similar to ðŸ’¾) in VBE's toolbar.
.. Check that the file (really) was saved by having a look at the "`last modified date`" of the AddIn file in the Windows Explorer.

[#addin-loading-order]
=== Ensure right loading order of AddIns

Last you need to make sure that the AddIns (whose links should be fixed) are loaded *after* the `+FixLinks2UDF+` AddIn. This (safely) can be done by

. opening Excel's menu:Add-Ins[] window (e.g. menu:Developer[Add-ins > Excel Add-ins]),
. activating the AddIn `+FixLinks2UDF+` (it should already be active if you have followed this guide),
. deactivating all AddIns which were modified as specified above, i.e. whose links should be fixed,
. confirming the selections by pressing the btn:[OK] button,
. closing Excel,
. reopening Excel and the menu:Add-Ins[] window,
. activating all AddIns which were modified as specified above, i.e. whose links should be fixed,
. confirming the selections by pressing the btn:[OK] button, and
. closing Excel (again).

[NOTE]
====
All the closing and reopening is needed to ensure that it really works.
Otherwise there are plenty of pitfalls that can (to the authors experience) easily lead to unexpected results.
====

[TIP]
====
If you want to check that there are no obvious errors you can

* reopen Excel,
* recheck in the menu:Add-Ins[] window that the relevant AddIns are checked, and
* check the menu:Immediate[] window in the VBE (kbd:[Ctrl+G]) that there are no messages like

 !!! <Workbook name of AddIn>: The AddIn 'FixLinks2UDF' is blocked or isn't found.

Hopefully the stated message is clear enough what might be wrong.
For the first cause have a look at the corresponding <<FAQ>> entry.
For the second cause most likely the `+FixLinks2UDF+` AddIn isn't loaded before the AddIn named in the Immediate window.
Redo the steps from the previous list to fix this.
====

== Usage / Show it in action

If you have followed the instructions given in the <<#how-to-install>> section, possible "`old`"/outdated links should be updated automatically upon opening a respective Excel file.

In case you want to first see "`FixLinks2UDF`" in action before modifying our own AddIns, you can have a look at the link:{testdir}[tests] folder.
There you will find some test AddIns and a test file.
To assure that the test works fine, please check that you *first* activate the `+FixLinks2UDF+` AddIn and *then* activate the "`test`" AddIns!

== Running Tests

Unfortunately we don't know how to create automated tests/unit tests for this project.
If you have an idea, we would love to see it!
Please add an issue or â€“ even better â€“ a pull request (see the <<#contributing>> section).

But of course one can manually test it.
Please have a look at the link:{testdir}[tests] folder.

== Used By

This project is used by (at least) these projects:

* http://www.unitoperations.de/[]

If you know more, we will be happy to add them here.
In addition it is used by a lot of private, i.e. non-public, Excel AddIns created by the authors.

== Known issues and limitations

None that we are aware of.

[#contributing]
== Contributing

All contributions are highly welcome!!

If you are new to git/GitHub, please have a look at {uri-GitHub-FirstContribution} where you will find a lot of useful information for beginners.

We recently were pointed to {uri-commit-messages} which sounds very promising.
We will use them from now on too (and hopefully don't forget it in a hurry).

[#FAQ]
== FAQ

[qanda]
What are the `+'@...+` comments good for in the code?::
You should really have a look at the awesome {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck] project!

Although the loading order of the AddIns is correct, I (still) get the "!!! ..." message(s) in the Immediate Window. What can I do against it?::
Then most likely the `+FixLinks2UDF+` AddIn is blocked by Windows.
A quick indicator for that is, that this AddIn isn't listed in the VBE's "`Code Explorer`"/"`Project Explorer`".
To confirm and fix this suspicion, please have a look at Jan Karel Pieterse's article: {uri-JKP-ExcelAddInsFailToLoad}[Excel add-ins fail to load]
