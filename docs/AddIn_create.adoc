You have two choices to make the functionality work, i.e. to fix the links to UDFs in AddIns.
Either you create a "`wrapper`" AddIn named `+FixLinks2UDF.xlam+` that handles the fixes or you use the code "`stand-alone`" which means that you add the code to each AddIn which UDFs links should be fixed. The former has the benefit that you only have *one* place to incorporate fixes and/or new features.

== "`Wrapper`" AddIn

. Open a fresh/new Excel file.
. Open the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) (kbd:[Alt+F11]).
. Add the modules and class modules in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder (without the files from the `+Client+` subfolder) to the project.
** With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
.. Right-click on the project to which you want to add the modules in the "`Code Explorer`" (to show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R]) and click on menu:Add[Existing Files...].
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder and click on btn:[Open].
** Without Rubberduck:
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder except `+ThisWorkbook.doccls+` in Windows File Explorer.
.. Drag-and-drop them to the corresponding project in VBE's "`Project Explorer`". +
   (To show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R].
   Hit it twice if the Code Explorer shows up first.)
.. Open link:{sourcedir}/ThisWorkbook.doccls[`+ThisWorkbook.doccls+`] in an editor, copy its content, and paste it to the `+ThisWorkbook+` class module (which can be found in the "`Microsoft Excel Objects`").
. Add a reference to the "`Microsoft Scripting Runtime`" library.
** With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
.. Right-click somewhere on the project in the Code Explorer and click on menu:Add/Remove{sp}References...[].
.. Type (parts of) the library name in the search box until you see it in below (left) list.
.. Select the library in the (left) list and click on the btn:[âž¨] button to add it to the project references.
.. Click on the btn:[OK] button to close the window.
** Without Rubberduck:
.. Open the Reference manager in the VBE (menu:Tools[References...]).
.. Add a checkmark to the corresponding library.
.. Click on the btn:[OK] button to close the window.
. Change project name to `FixLinks2UDF`
** With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
.. Right-click on the project to which you added the modules in the Code Explorer,
.. click on menu:Project Properties[], and
.. change the "`Project Name`" accordingly.
** Without Rubberduck:
.. Right-click on the project to which you added the modules in the VBE Project Explorer,
.. click on menu:VBAProject Properties...[], and
.. change the "`Project Name`" accordingly.
. Check, if there are obvious errors by compiling the project (menu:Debug[Compile FixLinks2UDF]).
. Save the file/project as `+FixLinks2UDF.xlam+`.
.. In Excel (not the VBE) press the btn:[Save] button (e.g. in the Quick Access Toolbar),
.. change the "`Save as type`" value to "`Excel Add-in (*.xlam)`",
.. change the "`File name`" accordingly, and
.. save it in a location of your choice by pressing the btn:[Save] button.
   (It is perfectly fine to use the folder that is suggested/shown by Excel when you change the "`Save as type`" value.)
. Close Excel
. Activate the AddIn
.. by opening Excel,
.. opening the menu:Add-Ins[] window (e.g. menu:Developer[Add-ins > Excel Add-ins]), and
.. adding a checkmark at the `+FixLinks2UDF+` entry.
. Run the sub `+SetDocumentProperties+` in the `+modDocumentProperties+` module.
.. Open the VBE (kbd:[Alt+F11]),
.. open the module `+modDocumentProperties+` (via Code Explorer or Project Explorer),
.. place the cursor somewhere in the procedure `+SetDocumentProperties+`, and
.. run that sub (e.g. by pressing kbd:[F5]).

== "`Standalone`" AddIn

. Open the VBA project, to which you want to add the FixLinks2UDF functionality in the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) (kbd:[Alt+F11]).
. Add the modules and class modules in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder except the `+ThisWorkbook.doccls+` to the project.
** With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
.. Right-click on the project to which you want to add the modules in the "`Code Explorer`" (to show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R]) and click on menu:Sync Project[Update Components from Files...].
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder except the `+ThisWorkbook.doccls+` and click on btn:[Open].
.. Open link:{sourcedir}/ThisWorkbook.doccls[`+ThisWorkbook.doccls+`] in an editor and merge its content with the (maybe present) content of `+ThisWorkbook+` class module.
** Without Rubberduck:
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder except `+ThisWorkbook.doccls+` and drag-and-drop it to the corresponding project in VBE's Project Explorer.
.. Open link:{sourcedir}/ThisWorkbook.doccls[`+ThisWorkbook.doccls+`] in an editor and merge its content with the (maybe present) content of `+ThisWorkbook+` class module (which can be found in the "`Microsoft Excel Objects`").
. Add a reference to the "`Microsoft Scripting Runtime`" library.
** With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
.. Right-click somewhere on the project in the Code Explorer and click on menu:Add/Remove{sp}References...[].
.. Type (parts of) the library name in the search box until you see it in below (left) list.
.. Select the library in the (left) list and click on the btn:[âž¨] button to add it to the project references.
.. Click on the btn:[OK] button to close the window.
** Without Rubberduck:
.. Open the Reference manager in the VBE (menu:Tools[References...]).
.. Add a checkmark to the corresponding library.
.. Click on the btn:[OK] button to close the window.
// BUG: "project name" can't be put in normal angle brackets, because the closing bracket would be interpreted as menu delimiter. I couldn't find a way how to "escape" that (i.e. a backslash didn't work). Thus, single guillemets are used.
. Check, if there are obvious errors by compiling the project (menu:Debug[Compile â€¹project nameâ€º]).
. Save the AddIn/project.
.. Be sure that the AddIn/project you want to save is "`active`" in the VBE by checking, if its name is shown in VBE's title bar. +
   (If it's not, open a (class) module of the corresponding AddIn (and close it again).)
.. Press the "`Save`" button (the disc symbol similar to ðŸ’¾) in VBE's toolbar.
.. Check that the file (really) was saved by having a look at the "`last modified date`" of the AddIn file in the Windows File Explorer.
. Close Excel
